## Algorithmic Trading for Gold and Gold Miner ETFs

Note: project is in progress!

### Project Overview
The goal of this algorithmic trading experiment is to predict (or provide strong signals for) buying and selling points in the UGL stock based on gold miner ETFs. My father and I worked on this project together; he pinpointed the relationship between the ETFs, while I built the algorithm from scratch and streamlined the predicting process using Python. So far, our algorithm does a better job showing signals for low (buying) points than high (selling) points.
