## DataHacks 2021: Bitcoin Ransomware Classification

### Project Overview
The UCSD DataHacks 2021 featured the Bitcoin project as an Intermediate Track. The goal of the project is to "Define a machine learning model most appropriate for classifying heist incidents into ransomware families. Then, define a model to predict if a future transaction is ransom or not, and if it is, the ransomware family it belongs to."

My team and I were all fairly new to machine learning, but we adapted quickly to the prompt's demands and submitted a complete report to the panel of professionals within 36 hours.
