### Introduction
Diffusion models have gained popularity due to their effectiveness in various creative and practical applications. They have been extensively used in text-to-image generation, layout-to-image generation, image inpainting, and resolution enhancement. Our project simplifies the application of diffusion models to a 2D dataset, specifically the Swiss roll dataset, aiming to clarify the mathematical and visual concepts behind how a basic diffusion model operates.
