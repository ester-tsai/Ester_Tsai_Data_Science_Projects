## Database Management Task Automation

### Project Overview
For my Database Management internship at Easy Event Planning, I worked directly under the CEO, Kathleen Kilmer, to automate tasks that used to be manual and time-consuming. I picked up Python web scraping and advanced Excel to expedite repetitive manual processes such as data collection and data validation, then wrote instructions and held training sessions for the team of seven students. (The CEO loved how I go beyond the bare minimum and imagine bigger possibilities, stating how it was one of her best decisions to appoint me as team lead.)

One of the tasks involved identifying which interns' SEO works advanced to the first page of Google by appending student names to the company's SEO analytics report. This was a complicated, multi-stepped task that I tackled on and solved using Google Sheets, Excel, and Jupyter Notebook. Because this is a crucial task that needs to be done weekly, the CEO asked me to train the next cohort of interns, so they can carry on performing this task. In order to make it easier for the next cohort, I created a Python data appending template, an intructions document, and a tutorial video, then Zoom called the interns to make sure they know how to use these resources. 

In another task, the team received a list of 5000+ invalid city and state names (misspelled or completely wrong), and for each location we had to search up the correct location name and its coordinates, or mark the name as "remove." The team started out searching every name up manually, and each row took 30 seconds to 2 minutes to complete. If each team member contributed 2 hours a day, it would take 6 days or more to complete the task, not counting the time to proof-read. It felt very inefficient to do this task row by row manually, so I attempted to web scrape with the invalid city and state names as input, and the Google-corrected names and coordinates as outputs. With some finer tweaking, I 

I'm glad I was able to help the company automate tasks and launch a system of resources for future interns. Some representative tasks are:

### Task 0: Conduct Training Sessions on Data Appending and Web Scraping

### Task 1: Append Student Names from Multiple Sources to SEO Analytics Report and Create Tutorial for Future Interns

### Task 2: Recover Cities Missing from City Redirects Sheet

### Task 3: Allow People to Search for a Market Based on Neighborhood

### Task 4: Scrape Google for Vendorsâ€™ Missing Info

### Task 5: Resolve Duplicates in Bridal Show Sales
